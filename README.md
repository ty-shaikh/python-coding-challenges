## Python Coding Challenges

This repo contains a set of 18 coding challenges. These are representative of questions you might get at an early-stage startup for a software engineering role or data scientist role.

I would categorize them as easy. Highly sought after technology companies like Google and Facebook use much more difficult challenges.

The challenges are in a Jupyter notebook and the solutions are available as well.
